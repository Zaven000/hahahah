            <h3>Dear Samvel Nersisyan</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>You have been randomly selected for further processing in the Diversity Immigrant Visa
                Program for the fiscal year 2016 (May, 7 to September, 2024). Selection does not guarantee that you will receive a visa because the number of applicants selected is greater than the number of visas available. Please print out this letter and take it with you to your visa interview.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Approximately 55,000 individuals were registered for further processing. Therefore, it is very important that you carefully follow instructions to increase your chances of possible visa issuance. The instructions are located on the Department of State website at http://www.dyselectee.state.gov. AlI DV-2016 applicants must use the online DS-260 Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration Application. Paper forms will not be accepted.
